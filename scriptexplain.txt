Included files: Vagrantfile, checkip.sh, bootstrap.sh

Vagrantfile is configured to create "ubuntu14-cloudimage" vm machine. After which it calls bootstrap.sh to install and configure Apache server. Finally it calls checkip.sh to check current IP against checkip.dyndns.org website and outputs results to file called ipcheck.txt. 

Warning during install of MySql can be ignored as the file is modified after install in bootstrap.sh

Vagrantfile configurations:
config.vm.box = "ubuntu14-cloudimage"
  config.vm.box_url = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box"
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh"
  config.vm.hostname = "dev-test.localhost"
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "checkip.sh"

boostrap.sh -p <password>
