Included files: Vagrantfile, checkip.sh, bootstrap.sh

Vagrantfile is configured to create "ubuntu14-cloudimage" vm machine. After which it calls bootstrap.sh to install and configure Apache server. Finally it calls checkip.sh to check current IP against checkip.dyndns.org website and outputs results to file called ipcheck.txt. 

Vagrantfile configurations:
config.vm.box = "ubuntu14-cloudimage"
  config.vm.box_url = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box"
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh"
  config.vm.hostname = "dev-test.localhost"
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "checkip.sh"

boostrap.sh
Set DEBIAN_FRONTEND to noninteractive to prevent unnecessary errors. 
Use apt-get to update server.
Use apt-get to install Apache Server. 

checkip.sh
Get current datetime.
Execute wget command to get ip address. Results are formatted using sed. 
Use echo to output datetime and IP to file called ipcheck.txt formatted as <datetimestamp> | <ip addres>
